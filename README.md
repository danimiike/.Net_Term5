# .Net_Term5_MemoryGame
Created a .NET 5.0 (.NET Core) library assembly using C# that provides game services for the 
card game Quiddlerâ„¢. Also implemented a .NET 5.0 client that demonstrates the services provided by the class library by managing user inputs and generating all output in the console.
